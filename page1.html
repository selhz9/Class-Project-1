            <h2>Rules:</h2>
            <p>The entire deck is dealt out and split between two players. Each player flips over one card at a time, and the highest card value wins. The winner takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck. The game continues until one player has no cards left, and the other player wins by having the full deck.</p>
